# Welcome to my new personal website

## My name is Nathan Patnam and I am currently an undergradraduate student at Wofford College majoring in Computer Science

### This Summer I interned at Salesforce and was doing full-stack development using Ember.js, GraphQL, Purple3 (CSS Library), Mirage & QUnit. I enjoyed learning and using these tools so much that I decided to recreate my personal website using them
