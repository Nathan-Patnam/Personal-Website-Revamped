# Welcome to my Personal Website's GitHub Repo

## My name is Nathan Patnam and I am currently an undergradraduate student at Wofford College majoring in Computer Science

### This Summer I interned at Salesforce where I was doing full-stack development using Ember.js, GraphQL, Purple3 (CSS Library), Mirage & QUnit. I enjoyed learning and using Ember.js and so I wanted to rebuild my website using it.
