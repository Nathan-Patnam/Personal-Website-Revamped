-   For testing this website across multiple browsers and devices, I decided to
    use BrowserStack
    ![](https://3fxtqy18kygf3on3bu39kh93-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/browserstack/img/browserstack-logo.svg)
    to do that. BrowserStack is a interactive web-based tool that can test your
    website on over 2000 browsers and real devices instantly. You can learn more
    about it [here](https://www.browserstack.com/)
