## About The Project

My name is Nathan Patnam and I am currently an undergradraduate student at
Wofford College majoring in Computer Science

This Summer I interned at Salesforce where I was doing full-stack development
using Ember.js, GraphQL, Purple3 (CSS Library), Mirage & QUnit. I enjoyed
learning and using Ember.js and so I wanted to rebuild my website using it.

### Built With
