                'What did I like about his teaching? - I enjoyed how he asked me questions for my understanding, instead of teaching the whole time and assuming that I understood everything. - He had no problem with explaining any topic that I was unfamiliar with, as he taught me about Stacks and Queues. - He sent me resources and practice questions after the lesson, which let me know that he truly wants to invest into my learning. - He asked me, "How do you like my teaching?" after the first hour, and was willing to shift gears regarding the structure of the lesson, if requested.What did he help me accomplish? He helped me to understand the fundamentals of Stacks and how Graph problems work.Now, I am aware of what type of Stack or Graph problems might be asked during technical interviews with popular companies, and how to approach them.The information learned was was invaluable to me! I wish that I had Nathan tutor me a month ago, because it was honestly a very effective lesson, and I plan to have him tutor me frequently.',

He gave me some great tips about how to approach coding interviews, and provided links to YouTube videos that reinforce the topics we talked about and prepare me for further lessons with him.',
